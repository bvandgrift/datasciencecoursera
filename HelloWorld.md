## This is a markdown file

now that that's out of the way -- if you're grading this, you'll be interestd to
know that markdown is fantastic in a number of ways. compare the source of this
file to the rendered version (which will be HelloWorld.pdf in this directory).
first, it separates paragraphs out via a double line

see?  also, headers:

# this is a top level header

this is also a top level header
===============================

## this is level 2

also level 2
----

### this is a level 3 header

headers go up to 5 now?  you can also use regular html in here if you like:

<h4> a level 4 header from html</h4>

Want lists?

* unordered
* lists
    * with sublists
    * indented 4 spaces
* 4 spaces is key 

1. ordered
1. lists
    1. can also be indented
    1. yes, four spaces
3. and can use arbitrary `#.` markers

`was that source notation?` yes, it was.

can i also _italicize_ (em) and **bold** (strong) things? of course.

what about [hypertext links](http://github.com/bvandgrift)? they're trickier,
but still around.

    we can even create a block
    of source-code style text
    with that four-space indent thing

tables work in some flavors of markdown, but not all. likewise, footnotes[^fn1] 
work in some but not all flavors. probably don't want to worry about
flavor-dependent things unless you're doing the rendering yourself.

enjoy!
